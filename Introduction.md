## 📌 What is a Table?
A **Table** stores data in **rows and columns**, like an Excel sheet.

**Example:**

| Roll No | Name  | Marks |

| 2 | Meena | 90 |

---

## 📌 What is a Column?
A **Column** represents **one type of data**.

**Examples:**
- Name column → stores names
- Marks column → stores marks

In the table above:
- `Roll No` is a column
- `Name` is a column
- `Marks` is a column

---

## 📌 What is a Row?
A **Row** represents **one complete record (one person)**.

**Example:**
- `1 | Arun | 85` → one row (Arun’s full details)
- `2 | Meena | 90` → one row (Meena’s full details)

---

## 📌 What is a Primary Key?
A **Primary Key** is a column used to **uniquely identify each row**.

**Rules:**
- Cannot repeat
- Cannot be empty

**Example:**
- Roll No is a Primary Key
- Two students can have the same name, but not the same roll number

---

## 📌 What is DBMS?
**DBMS (Database Management System)** is software that manages databases.

**DBMS helps to:**
- Create data
- Read data
- Update data
- Delete data

**Examples of DBMS:**
- MySQL
- Oracle

---

## 📌 What is SQL?
**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the language used to **communicate with a database**.

**Simple meaning:**  
> SQL = Language to talk to the database.

## 📌 4 Main SQL Commands (CRUD)

### 1. SELECT
Used to **view data**.

### 2. INSERT
Used to **add new data**.

### 3. UPDATE
Used to **change existing data**.

### 4. DELETE
Used to **remove data**.

**Memory Trick (CRUD):**
- Create → INSERT
- Read → SELECT
- Update → UPDATE
- Delete → DELETE

## 📌 Example: Student Table Operations

### Initial Table

| Roll No | Name  | Marks |

|--------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Arun | 85 |
| 2 | Meena | 90 |
